# Unity.Animation.Samples

This repository contains projects that showcase the new DOTS animation package (com.unity.animation).

You will find a brief explanation of each sample [here](UnityAnimationHDRPExamples/README.md).

The AnimationCurves live in a different assembly. You can read more [here](UnityAnimationHDRPExamples/Assets/Scenes/AnimationCurve/README.md) about the provided example.

# Disclaimer

DOTS animation package is highly experimental. We want you to know it's there, we invite you to peek at it and consider what it might mean for you and the future of Unity. What we don't want you to do is to rely on it as if it's something ready for professional production.
- Will work on 2019.3b11 and up
- HDRP GPU skinning only... URP will be next
- Not (yet!) for production use.
- Early picture of what the DOTS animation system, might not be representative of the final version.
- You will need to be tech savvy to use this version. Not yet ready for everyone.
- Core system only, many animation tools are missing.
- Things will change.
